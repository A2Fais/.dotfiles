Welcome to my dotfiles repository! This repository contains configuration files and a setup script to quickly configure your environment. The `init.zsh` script automates the process of symlinking these configuration files.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **GNU Stow**: Used to manage symlinks
- **Zsh**: Required to execute the `init.zsh` script.

## Setup Instructions

Execute the file 
   ```zsh
   ./init.zsh
